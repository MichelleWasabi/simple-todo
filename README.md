# simple-todo
Practice Project: using JavaScript to create simple todo list that saves on local storage.  

I want to grow more confident in using JavaScript so I'm returning to some previous tutorials and lessons as a way of praticing JS syntax. I'm also pushing myself to problem-solve, plan, and comment more clearly. 

With this simple todo app you can add new list items, delete single items or the whole list, and save the list to local storare. The UI is built with materialize css. 

### next steps
add checkboxes and animation for when items are checked off the list.
